This is Promiwag (from Protection Middle-Ware Generator).

It is research project which, for now, provides code generation for
(stateless) packet parsing code.

The Why (http://why.lri.fr/) output is used together with Alt-Ergo
(http://alt-ergo.lri.fr/) to prove that, for any input packet, the
generated code: 
- Cannot perform unsafe memory accesses;
- Will always finish eventually (i.e. no infinite loops can be
  triggered).

The project was presented in a paper at IFIP Sec 2011:
