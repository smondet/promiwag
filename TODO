To do:


* start using PolyComp
* Promiwag_meta_packet: heavy testing (TCP and UDP packets)
* Promiwag_meta_packet: add request `size of field


+ a while+switch manager for parsing encapsulations of packets


? Promiwag_platform: Generate an "inspector.c" piece of code which
  retrives endianism, sizeof's, etc ... as OCaml code ...

? A module _intermediate_language ?
  - C-like semantics but much simpler
  - without need to declare variables at the beginning
  - interpretable/optimisable
  - types: int8, int16, int32, int64, float (= double),
           buffer (pointer + size)
