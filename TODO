To do:


* start using PolyComp
* Promiwag_meta_packet: heavy testing (TCP and UDP packets)
? Promiwag_stiel: use Genlex for expressions
* Promiwag_stiel: interpret
* Promiwag_stiel: Write_{int,...}_to_buffer i.e. a controled/typed
  asignement of *buffer.
* Promiwag_stiel: Max depth for variables

* Promiwag_stiel: check that ints are positive
* Promiwag_stiel:
  - add the "Exception" int,bool expressions (?)
  OR
  - look_for_divisions which retrieves all denominators
  and generates checks

* use Format, or EasyFormat for printing C and Stiel

* need datastructures:
  - replace hashtables when order is needed 
  (also purity is useful for e.g. removing a variable from environment)
  - replace list when a lot of concatenations

* module SafeInt64, with all bounds checkings

+ a while+switch manager for parsing encapsulations of packets


? Promiwag_platform: Generate an "inspector.c" piece of code which
  retrives endianism, sizeof's, etc ... as OCaml code ...

? A module _intermediate_language => Promiwag_stiel
  - C-like semantics but much simpler
  - without need to declare variables at the beginning
  - interpretable/optimisable (=> formally verifiable?)
  - types: int8, int16, int32, int64, float (= double),
           buffer (pointer + size)
