To do:

* start using PolyComp
* Promiwag_platform: Generate an "inspector.c" piece of code which
  retrives endianism, sizeof's, etc ... as OCaml code ...
* a request of offset should be a difference from current packet
  a request of address should be a pointer
  a integers should be retrieved with minimal size
* Promiwag_meta_packet: maxsize testing
* Promiwag_meta_packet: heavy testing
+ Promiwag_meta_packet: when need address, a useless variable is created
